# Inflation Rate Prediction System

## Descriptions
The Inflation Rate Prediction Application is a user-friendly platform that utilizes advanced machine 
learning techniques to provide accurate predictions of future inflation rates. By inputting relevant 
economic data such as GDP growth, consumer price index, and interest rates, users can access reliable 
predictions and gain insights into the key factors driving inflation rates. The website's models are trained 
on historical data, and feature engineering techniques are employed to handle different data types, 
missing values, and outliers. The platform is designed to empower economists, policymakers, investors, 
and individuals with valuable information for decision-making. It offers a robust tool to anticipate and 
analyze inflation trends, aiding users in making informed strategic choices. With its ability to handle 
complex relationships and nonlinear dynamics within economic datasets, the Machine Learning 
Inflation Rate Prediction Website provides a reliable and efficient solution for understanding and 
predicting inflation rates.
